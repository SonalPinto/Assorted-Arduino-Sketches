# Assorted-Arduino-Sketches
Assorted Arduino Sketches. There is some AVR ASM in here.

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ASM_test  | AVR ASM "hello world" test for Arduino through the IDE itself. Some array manipulation.  |
| bcd_counter | BCD counter |
| blinky | LED blink |
| dft_asm | 16pt DFT in entirely AVR asm. Masochistic. |
| dft_asm_32 | 32pt DFT in AVR asm. You thought 16b was the limit...? Do not be alarmed by the look up tables. |
| dft_C | 64pt DFT in vanilla AVR-C. Plus character LCD control. Check https://github.com/SonalPinto/arduino_DFT |
| dft_test | 16pt DFT test in AVR-C |
| LCD_test | Character LCD "Hello world" |
| micTest | Mic Test |
| mulCheck | 16b Multiply in AVR asm |
| oled_test | SSD1306 OLED test |
| oled_test2 | more SSD1306 OLED test |
| oled_test3 | MORE SSD1306 OLED test. Check https://github.com/SonalPinto/Arduino_SSD1306_OLED |
| serial_test | serial comms test |
| sqrt_asm | Square Root in AVR ASM. 8/16b longhand and iterative |
| sqrt_asm2 | Test AVR ASM square root vs C function. 5x faster in asm... |
